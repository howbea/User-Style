# User Style    
This is a new Gnome Shell theme loader that loads light, dark and high-contrast stylesheets.         
Please put 2 or 3 files in ~/.themes/THEME NAME/gnome-shell. Those files are at https://github.com/howbea/gnome-shell-theme.    
Optionally you can choose default color variant.    
Enjoy my extension.
